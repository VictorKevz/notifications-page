# Notifications Page
![alt text](public/design/desktop-preview.jpg)
This repository contains the solution to the [Notifications Page Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC) from Frontend Mentor. The challenge involves building a notifications page and making it as close to the provided design as possible. You can view the live site [here](https://victorkevz.github.io/notifications-page/).

## Overview

This project is a brilliant test of your HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript skills. You will use JavaScript to toggle the visual state of the notifications. The solution dynamically renders the cards for easy scalability and maintainability, though you can also use standard HTML if preferred.

### Features

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications.
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- React.js
- Vite

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VictorKevz/notifications-page.git
   cd notifications-page
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the project in action.

## Usage

The notifications page is interactive, allowing users to:

1. **Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications**:
   - Unread notifications have a distinct visual style.
   - Clicking on an unread notification will mark it as read.

2. **Mark all notifications as read**:
   - Click the "Mark all as read" button to mark all notifications as read.
   - The number of unread messages will be set to zero.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

4. **Hover and Focus States**:
   - All interactive elements have clear hover and focus states to enhance usability.
